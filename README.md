# release.sh

This is a simple example for a relatively comfortable deployment for Composer based TYPO3 projects.

The file can be placed in the project directory and started via ./release.sh.

Before that make the file executable via chmod +x release.sh.

The parameter *rollback* can be used to roll back to the previous release in case of a problem. (./release.sh rollback)
